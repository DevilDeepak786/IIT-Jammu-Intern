A wideband and high-efficiency reflective polarization converter based on meta surface is suggested in this report to convert the LP incident EM into orthogonal LP reflection waves in the lower band and CP reflection waves in the higher band.
The simulation findings show that it achieves greater than 0.88 PCR for a linear-to-linear polarization conversion from 7 to 12.3GHz.
Furthermore, a fractional bandwidth of 13.0% from 14.7 to 15.62 GHz can be obtained for a linear-to-circular polarization conversion.
The experimental results agree reasonably well with the simulations.
Because of its linear-to-linear and linear-to-circular polarization conversion capabilities, the suggested design has potential applications in polarization-manipulation devices and antenna design.
